It's time to put all your HTMl and CSS skills to the test by building your own personal website. We'll be using a Boostrap theme that you can edit and change.

##Some Things You Should Know

You're going to be tackling the lesson `Build Your Own Personal Website`. Once you finish this, you can then deploy it, and have a live personal website on the internet that you can send to friends and family, and come up in google search results!

If you finish and want more, feel free to build another website!

## Share Share Share!

Now that you've built your own website, it's time to show it off! Share your site with **\#flatironcodeclub** and **\#ibuiltthis**.
